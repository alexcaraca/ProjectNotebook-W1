The purpose is to help to decide in which parish should I open a restaurant or any other kind of business that I may considerer.\n\nThe first obstacule that I may find is to get the GPS coordenates of all the parishes of the city.\n\nA limitation of this analysis that I may encounter is that all the conclusions will be taken without financial values (namely price of acquistion and/ or rental of the space).\n\nThis exercise could be helpfull to anyone interested in open a new business."
